# Game Of Life

I've wanted to make Game Of Life for a long time. And finally, I found the time 
for it and did it in Java! The project doesn't have affluent functional (like
drawing, start/pause or something) but I wanted to touch to the main algorithm
of the game. The current state of the code doesn't look good but I'll try to 
make the code better a bit later.
